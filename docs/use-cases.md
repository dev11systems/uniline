# Use Cases

This document outlines scenarios where Uniline may be useful.

---

## Disaster Response

* IP networks and cellular data are down or overloaded.
* Emergency operations centers, shelters, and clinics still have one or more working analog lines.
* Uniline nodes provide:

  * basic encrypted text channels for coordination
  * TTY-style text fallback over degraded lines
  * occasional voice calls via a smartphone acting as a handset

---

## Community Resilience

* Neighborhood hubs, schools, or libraries have copper lines even when home connections fail.
* Uniline nodes can:

  * link local hubs together over PSTN
  * report shelter capacity, supply status, and safety updates
  * provide a simple way for residents to send “I’m safe” messages

---

## Clinics and Small Institutions

* Small clinics or local governments may keep a single analog line for redundancy.
* Uniline lets them:

  * maintain contact with regional centers
  * share basic status and requests during outages
  * place or receive voice calls when other phones are unavailable

---

## Accessibility and TTY

* TTY and relay services are still in use in various regions.
* Uniline:

  * enables TTY calls from a phone/laptop without a dedicated TTY terminal
  * can operate on noisy, degraded lines using robust Baudot tones
  * allows text-based communication when voice is not available or reliable

---

## Research and Education

* Telephony and resilience researchers can use Uniline to:

  * study PSTN behavior under stress
  * experiment with low-bandwidth encryption schemes
  * teach analog/digital interface concepts
  * explore accessibility in emergency communication design
